				<div class="bodyText"> The less you know, the better. Really.</div>
				<br><br>
				<div class="bodyText">BUT, if you insist on knowing, then we are a group of engineering students at Northwestern University who are NOT dedicated to your public speaking needs, but rather to learning about human-computer interactions (i.e. designing a nice user interface).</div>
				<br><br>
				<div class="bodyText">We are sorry to disappoint, but hope that you will take a few minutes to navigate around the website to admire our work. If you have any feedback, praise, or concerns, good job for thinking critically about the website in front of you!</div>
